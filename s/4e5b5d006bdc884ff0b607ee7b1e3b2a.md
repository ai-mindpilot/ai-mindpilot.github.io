As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to choose any animal. But here are some options that you could consider:

1. Cheetah - for their incredible speed and agility
2. Eagle - for their excellent eyesight and ability to fly
3. Octopus - for their adaptability and camouflage ability
4. Bat - for their echolocation skills
5. Dolphin - for their communication and swimming abilities.
