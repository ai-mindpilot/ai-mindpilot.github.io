As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or perspectives. But based on scientific research and theories, the edge of the universe is not a physical boundary that can be located in space or time. The universe is constantly expanding, and this expansion has been accelerating since the Big Bang. As a result, there are regions of the universe that are moving away from us faster than the speed of light, making them impossible to see or reach. Therefore, the concept of an "edge" of the universe is not applicable in the traditional sense.
